this is an app. it is so because it has access to db and keeps data from users. each user can login (if they have signin) and do their stuff with the app, then logout, and when they login again the recover their stuff (data) where they left before. that is, this app keeps state from user interaction with the app. it is made with react which connects to an api made with graphql.
